Description: This program calls word to spell check from Visual Basic.
It creates a Word.Basic object and invokes its methods. I have added a few
little features thought the program to answer questions people have asked me
in the past this way you have the source. I Wrote this utitly to be able to 
check my spelling fast without haveing to load programs that would take a lot of
system resources.

Requirements: In order to use the spell checking feature in this program
you need to have Microsoft Word Installed on your Computer and every
computer you want to use this on.
