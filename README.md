### Description

This program calls word to spell check from Visual Basic. It creates a Word.Basic object and invokes its methods. I have added a few little features thought the program to answer questions people have asked me in the past this way you have the source. I Wrote this utitly to be able to check my spelling fast without haveing to load programs that would take a lot of system resources.

Requirements: In order to use the spell checking feature in this program you need to have Microsoft Word Installed on your Computer and every computer you want to use this on.
